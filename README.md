Retro Replay Bot is a Discord bot designed for managing events, staff signups, and open day notifications. It supports both **text commands** and **slash commands** with full modals for event creation.

---

## **Quick Command Cheat Sheet**

### **1️⃣ Text Commands (`!`)**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!help` / `!h` | Shows all available commands. |
| `!opendays` | Displays open days, today’s status (OPEN/CLOSED), and the next open day countdown. |
| `!createevent` | Opens a form to create a new event (restricted to `eventCreatorRoles`). |

### **2️⃣ Slash Commands (`/`)**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Shows all commands. |
| `/opendays` | Shows open days, today’s status, and the next open day. |
| `/createevent` | Opens a modal to create a new event (restricted to `eventCreatorRoles`). |

### **3️⃣ Event Creation (Modal Form)**

Only members with roles in `eventCreatorRoles` can create events.

**Steps:**

1. Run `/createevent` or `!createevent`.
2. Fill in the modal fields:
   - **Event Title:** Name of your event.
   - **Event Date:** Use `DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM` format (Example: `14-01-2026 18:30`).
3. Submit → The bot posts the event in the **Signup Channel**.

### **4️⃣ Event Signup**

- The bot automatically adds reaction emojis for each role:

| Emoji | Role |
|-------|------|
| 1️⃣ | Active Manager |
| 2️⃣ | Backup Manager |
| 3️⃣ | Bouncer |
| 4️⃣ | Bartender |
| 5️⃣ | Dancer |
| 6️⃣ | DJ |

- Users react to sign up. The embed updates automatically.

### **5️⃣ Cancel Event**

- Only `eventCreatorRoles` can cancel an event.
- Click the **Cancel Event** button in the embed.
- Once canceled:
  - Embed turns red.
  - Button is disabled.
  - Signups are frozen.

### **6️⃣ Open Days**

- Shows if today is open or closed.

Example:

📅 Open Days: Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
🕒 Today is: <t:1705183200:F>
❌ CLOSED TODAY
⏳ Next Open Day: <t:1705442400:R> (<t:1705442400:F>)


### **7️⃣ Notes**
